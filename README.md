# Module 6 Challenge

## Weather Dashboard

# Description

The aim of this project was to build a weather dashboard utilizing the third party API 'OpenWeather'. When the user searches for a city, they are presented with the current conditions, and the conditions for the next five days. The conditions displayed are temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representing the weather conditions. Once a city is searched, it appears in a search history, where its information can be accessed again by clicking on it.

# Usage
